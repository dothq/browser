<h1 align="center">Dot</h1>
<h3 align="center">A beautiful browser with darn-simple UI, based on Wexond.</h3>

## Features

* **Built in ad-blocker** - We all hate ads, so we releave the pain by having a ad-blocker built in. No downloads, nothing.
* **Fancy Discord Rich Presence** - Tell your Discord Friends what page you're looking at, or if you're just Idle on the home screen...
* **Minimalistic UI** - Forget Chrome, bye bye Firefox, see you later IE and Edge. Our UI beats all of them.
* **Support for Chrome Extensions** - Don't worry, we thought about you chrome users, all your Chrome Extensions are right here.
* **Dot Overlay** - A neat little overlay, which has bookmarks, a search box, downloads and more.
* **Tab Groups** - Organize your tabs in a breeze.
